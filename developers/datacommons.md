  some key open datasets that might be helpful in building an investigative
  archive.

# Data commons

The data below is available in [Follow the Money](followthemoney/) format, suitable for processing using [ftm](followthemoney/ftm.md) and [alephclient](alephclient.md) and direct import into Aleph.

## OpenSanctions

Sanctions lists, databases of politicians and criminal figures can be a good way to find leads within other data, using [cross-referencing](../guide/building-out-your-investigation/cross-referencing.md). The [OpenSanctions](http://opensanctions.org) project generates consolidated sanctions data from multiple sources, and provides the entries as Follow the Money \(FtM\) data.

{% hint style="warning" %}
OpenSanctions is currently being updated. Please check [OpenSanctions.org](http://opensanctions.org) for links to the sanctions FtM data.
{% endhint %}

## ICIJ OffshoreLeaks

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has published data from its major investigations, including the Offshore Leaks \(2013\), Panama Papers \(2016\) and Paradise Papers \(2017\).

We've developed a set of importers that convert this data to FollowTheMoney format, available here: [https://github.com/alephdata/offshoreleaks](https://github.com/alephdata/offshoreleaks)
