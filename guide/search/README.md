# Searching your data

Aleph stores vast numbers of [**documents**](https://docs.alephdata.org/guide/the-basics#documents), [**entities**](https://docs.alephdata.org/guide/the-basics#entities), and the relationships between entities across many [**datasets**](https://docs.alephdata.org/guide/the-basics#datasets). Here we'll explore how to narrow down or expand your search to methodically find the answers to your questions or just stumble on an interesting lead using Aleph's advanced set of search operators.

Get started by **learning the basics** of searching for documents and entities across the entire corpus of data you have access to in Aleph.

Learn about advanced methods to restrict your results to only **exact matches**, or to broaden your results to include **spelling variations** or **fuzzy matches**.

{% page-ref page="advanced-search-methods.md" %}

Looking for only **a** **specific type of content**, like PDF documents or companies? Or **within a fixed date range**? Or only for matches that **contain a specific address**? Learn how to apply filters to further hone your results.

Finally, learn about how to search **in more contained contexts**, like within the contents of an individual dataset or document.

## Searching for Datasets

The methods above are all focused on searches for **entities** and **documents** within Aleph, but what about searching for **a specific dataset** or for all of the datasets pertaining to a country?
